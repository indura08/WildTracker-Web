1
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,274
Happy Veteran's Day.

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:10,809
Now where have you hidden
the chocolate eggs?

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,314
Uh, they're everywhere, Fez.
Start looking.

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,986
So, Steven.
Isn't Veteran's Day romantic?

5
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:25,252
Oh, yeah. Government pawns
and missing limbs.

6
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,718
<i>That's amore.</i>

7
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:32,253
I know, I know. It's a day for
people in love to have fun together.

8
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,733
You know what? All this talk about
having fun makes me want to have fun.

9
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:39,294
Hey, let's throw stuff
at other stuff.

10
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,698
Man, that's perfect.
I've got stuff.

11
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:44,710
- I'm in.
- Let's do it.

12
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,338
So, Steven.

13
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:52,283
Would you like to go to
Mr. Forman's barbecue with me?

14
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,786
No.

15
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:58,756
- As a matter of fact, I don't want to go anywhere with you.
- You know, that's okay.

16
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:02,625
You know what?
We can stay in.

17
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:05,357
No, Jackie. Look, I told you,
again and again...

18
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:09,198
I have no interest in you,
and you don't have a chance.

19
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,898
And yet, you keep thinking that I have
interest in you, and you have a chance.

20
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:18,838
Wait, did you just say that you're
interested in me and that I have a chance?

21
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:24,310
Okay. You know what?
You've forced me to do this.

22
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:29,048
I'm gonna explain my feelings to you through
a highly disciplined form of Japanese poetry...

23
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:31,352
haiku.

24
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,358
My heart aches with pain.

25
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,486
When I see you, I vomit.

26
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:42,468
Die away from me.

27
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:44,833
Ouch.

28
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:48,163
<i>Sayonara.</i>

29
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:57,582
Donna, never have 17 syllables
hurt me so much.

30
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,720
Why would he want to
hurt me like that?

31
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,484
Because you're
stalking him, Jackie.

32
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:08,357
- No, really, Donna.
- Jackie, really.

33
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,488
You are to Hyde
what Fez is to you.

34
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:15,398
That's ridiculous.
Fez and I will never happen.

35
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:19,130
Oh, God.

36
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,634
Steven and I
will never happen.

37
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,677
Jackie, it's all right.

38
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:27,577
You just gotta get over this
and be strong.

39
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:31,048
You're right, Donna.
You're right.

40
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:33,051
Oh, how I wish my daddy
could buy him for me.

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,089
Yeah, I know. I know.

42
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,318
This smell like
chocolate to you?

43
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:22,799
Look.
I'm Paul Stanley from KISS.

44
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,301
Kelso, don't play
with the cheese.

45
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,936
These damn kids.
They don't respect anything American.

46
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:37,346
Oh, Red, this isn't about the kids
misusing dairy products.

47
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,183
You're still upset that Bob
marched in the Veteran's Day parade.

48
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:44,756
Well, he was only
in the National Guard.

49
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,985
It's called Veteran's Day...

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,053
not... Pansy-ass,
National Guard...

51
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,496
Wussy, Pansy-ass Day.

52
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,469
Oh, come on, Red.

53
00:03:57,537 --> 00:04:01,029
Are any dirty Commies
less dead because of him?

54
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:05,834
No, I guess not.

55
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,142
You're right, Kitty.

56
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:12,378
You know, I'm gonna put away this
uniform, and then we'll fire up that grill.

57
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:14,784
Hey, Red.
Some parade, huh?

58
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:18,449
Yeah, sure was,
till the National Guard got there.

59
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,728
Look, I just came over
to invite you to my barbecue.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,934
Your barbecue?

61
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:33,871
Bob, I have an annual barbecue
every Veteran's Day.

62
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,874
It's my day...

63
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,876
because I'm a veteran.

64
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,576
Well, I'm a veteran too. And I'm having
a barbecue, and you can't stop me.

65
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,355
Hey, Mr. Pinciotti, I didn't know
you were in the Boy Scouts.

66
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:58,788
Ah.

67
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,131
Hey, everybody.
This is Chip.

68
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:05,193
He's been after me for a while now,
so I just said, "What the hell?"

69
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:08,672
- Chip, it's everybody.
- Hey, everybody.

70
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,936
Jackie, I'll, uh, get you
something to drink.

71
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,944
Whatever.

72
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,282
So you're with
this Chip guy now?

73
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,910
- Yep.
- Huh.

74
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,978
Why? Do you care?

75
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,150
No, I mean, if you want
to date this guy, that's cool.

76
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:28,284
It is?

77
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:32,422
And then Steven said,
"That's cool."

78
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,093
But not like "cool."
More like he's jealous.

79
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,831
Jackie, or he just
thinks it's cool.

80
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,567
Donna, it is so romantic.

81
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:43,609
<i>Just like West Side Story.</i>

82
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,343
Yeah, but without the dancing
and the Puerto Ricans.

83
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,815
Wait. Is Fez Puerto Rican?

84
00:05:55,555 --> 00:05:57,489
You know what?
I don't know.

85
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,491
Huh.

86
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,357
This will show Red. We're gonna
have the best barbecue ever.

87
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,060
If there's one thing you learn
in the National Guard, it's how to cook.

88
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,468
Oh, I'm gonna defrost some chicken.

89
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:17,306
Mom, the Formans have
a barbecue every Veteran's Day.

90
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,006
- I mean, why are we having one?
- Honey, this isn't about a barbecue.

91
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,106
This is about
your father going bankrupt.

92
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:27,243
- Now help me with these chairs.
- What? What are you talking about?

93
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,778
We need the chairs
for people to sit on.

94
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,424
No, Mom.
About Dad being bankrupt.

95
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:38,225
Your dad's appliance store's
going out of business...

96
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,458
'cause he can't compete
with Price Mart.

97
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,797
So he decided to throw
a big barbecue.

98
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,361
Okay, I'm still
not getting this.

99
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,739
Oh, your dad wants to be
big shot one last time...

100
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,644
before everybody discovers
what a failure he is.

101
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,877
- Oh, my God.
- And please don't tell anybody.

102
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,384
He's very sensitive
about being a failure.

103
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,195
Here you go.
Enjoy your burger.

104
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,757
And thank you for choosing the Formans
for your Veteran's Day celebration needs.

105
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:19,328
Kitty, why is everybody
over at Bob's?

106
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:21,896
They've got chicken.

107
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,438
Chicken?

108
00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:32,280
Well, isn't that a surprise?
A National Guardsman serving up chicken.

109
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,456
He's not gonna get away with this. Eric, chop
up some onions and mix it in with the meat.

110
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,890
Why can't we just put the onions
on top of the burger?

111
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,691
Eric, do you want to win
this thing or don't you?

112
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,796
Okay, not-crazy Dad.

113
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,737
- Eric, can I talk to you?
- Uh, not really, Donna. I got to bust hump.

114
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,470
- My dad wants to crush your dad's barbecue.
- What? Why?

115
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:02,708
Well, apparently, my dad believes that
if your dad's barbecue is better than his...

116
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:05,751
America will fall
to the Russkies.

117
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:10,084
Did you ever stop to think that maybe my
dad's barbecue is really important to him?

118
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,788
Uh, no.

119
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:19,388
Because it's just
a stupid barbecue.

120
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,333
It's not stupid.

121
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,596
I'm so sick of your dad.
He's such a jerk.

122
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,298
Whoa. My dad's a jerk?

123
00:08:27,373 --> 00:08:31,935
Well, Donna, your dad's a jerk,
and he's just copying my dad.

124
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,606
And your dad didn't even
fight in the war.

125
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,615
You're just
a National Guard kid.

126
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,084
Yeah, I said it.
What? What?

127
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:43,883
Oh, yeah? Well,
you and Red are going down.

128
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,890
And you know what else?
I was wrong, Eric.

129
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:48,722
Red's not a jerk.
He's an ass, and you're an ass.

130
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:52,161
'Cause the ass doesn't fall far from
the ass tree. "What did I say, what?"

131
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,772
Man, I can't believe Jackie
chose that guy over me.

132
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:12,181
- Or me for that matter.
- Yeah, that's true.

133
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,185
'Cause you're
a good-looking guy.

134
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,512
Back at you, Kelso.

135
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:21,827
Your eyelashes,
they go for, like, miles.

136
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,192
I've heard that.

137
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:27,721
Yeah. I'm what's known
as "man-pretty."

138
00:09:30,469 --> 00:09:34,667
Bad news, Dad.
The Pinciottis have... these.

139
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,544
Red, white and blue napkins?

140
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:42,103
That clever S.O.B.

141
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,873
And I cheaped out
and went for the plain white.

142
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:50,150
So what, now we surrender?

143
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:53,491
Surrender?

144
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:58,622
You know, if this were an actual war,
you'd be the first in a body bag.

145
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:01,633
Yes, sir. I'm gonna go
refill the ketchups.

146
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,801
Schlitz.

147
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:21,418
Hey, Jackie. Who's that hot guy
you brought with you?

148
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,422
Back off!
I need him for right now...

149
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:27,220
but you can have him
when I'm done, as usual.

150
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:33,757
Wait a second, Jackie.
Are you working an angle here? Nice.

151
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,859
No, there's no angle.

152
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,961
I just want to see
if I can make Steven jealous.

153
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,973
So you're gonna sleep with him
a couple of times and see what happens.

154
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:45,408
- Yeah, I've been down that road.
- No!

155
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:50,177
Oh, you're such a child. Send him
to my room when you're done.

156
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:56,315
- So, you and Jackie, huh?
- Yeah, isn't she something?

157
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,325
- Sure.
- Sometimes, though, I kind of hate it when she talks.

158
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,726
I hear you.

159
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:06,526
And she's always talking.

160
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:09,693
But, I figure it's worth it
if I can nail her.

161
00:11:10,736 --> 00:11:12,670
Huh.

162
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,536
Yeah, you should probably
think about that, man.

163
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,974
You know, I mean,
Jackie's kind of young.

164
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:21,844
- She only had, like, one boyfriend, so...
- Hey, that's not a big surprise.

165
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,939
You know, she's a bitch.

166
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,009
Oh, no.

167
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,192
- Steven, what happened?
- What?

168
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:39,857
Nothing. Just somebody... And then
the guy said "bitch," and there's nothing.

169
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,867
Oh, my God.
He called me a bitch?

170
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,201
And you hit him.
And that's what happened, isn't it?

171
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,274
No.

172
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:56,007
Liar. I am the bitch,
and you love me.

173
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,287
Stop staring at me.

174
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,920
Quit it.
I'm not this guy.

175
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:15,665
Oh, God.

176
00:12:26,044 --> 00:12:29,241
Oh, Steven, I saw what happened.
Is your girlfriend okay?

177
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:35,042
My girlfriend?

178
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,080
Yeah, the-the bossy, little, mean one
you're always hanging around with.

179
00:12:40,158 --> 00:12:43,150
- Oh, uh, Jackie.
- She's not my girlfriend.

180
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:45,628
Are you sure?

181
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:47,824
Yes, I'm sure.

182
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,837
I don't like her. She's... shallow
and rich and mean and bossy.

183
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:57,638
- She's everything that I hate.
- But, Steven, you hate everything.

184
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:02,305
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, it means that maybe you like her...

185
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:05,373
'cause I kind of think you do.

186
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,886
No. How could I like her?

187
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,479
Because I don't like her.
Because I can't like her.

188
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:14,583
Mrs. Forman,
if I like her, shoot me.

189
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,594
Pow!

190
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,402
Jackie, get your car.
We're going on a freakin' date.

191
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:42,979
Oh, my God.
It's a Veteran's Day miracle.

192
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,229
Red, white and blue
cheeseburgers.

193
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:54,458
Eric, you're a genius.

194
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,263
Voilà.

195
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,270
Sparkler dogs.

196
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,499
God bless America.

197
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:05,339
- Freshly squeezed.
- That's fresh.

198
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:08,911
Ah, beer in the bottle.

199
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,449
That's class.

200
00:14:11,516 --> 00:14:15,850
- The keg is tapped.
- Bend over and kiss it good-bye, Bob.

201
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:19,755
Here comes the big one.

202
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,454
A keg?

203
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:25,462
Oh, great.

204
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,691
Red's gone nuclear.

205
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:30,428
This barbecue is over.

206
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,835
Dad, that's it?
You're just gonna give up?

207
00:14:33,905 --> 00:14:36,305
We had sparkler dogs.
We could win this thing.

208
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,538
No. Donna, thanks.
But it's over.

209
00:14:39,611 --> 00:14:44,776
I just wanted one big blowout.
One last hurrah, you know?

210
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,876
Oh, why didn't I
rent the one-man band?

211
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:04,201
This is the best date ever.

212
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:09,406
Jackie, we haven't
talked in 30 minutes.

213
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:14,241
That's okay. Steven,
you don't have to say anything.

214
00:15:14,312 --> 00:15:16,405
I understand you.

215
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:19,541
- Oh, you do, do you?
- Sure.

216
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:22,280
Okay, so you're probably
sitting there thinking...

217
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:24,618
"I'm on this date
with this girl...

218
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,887
"who really,
really likes me.

219
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,951
And she's so beautiful."

220
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:33,361
- Jackie.
- Hush.

221
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,267
And you're wondering...

222
00:15:38,336 --> 00:15:40,668
"How can I open up to her...

223
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,766
"when everyone I have
ever loved have abandoned me?

224
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,437
Am I even worthy of love?"

225
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:53,851
Well, you are, Steven.
You are.

226
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,921
It's okay, Steven. It's okay.
Know what? Let it out.

227
00:16:03,995 --> 00:16:05,929
- Let it all out.
- Okay.

228
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:07,931
It's okay.

229
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:16,435
- Let's go home.
- Oh, come on. I'm kidding.

230
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,444
No, this is all right. We can
hang out here for a while, okay?

231
00:16:21,613 --> 00:16:24,343
God.

232
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,714
Here, have some of my pop.

233
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,878
Sure.

234
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,324
Okay.

235
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,564
- Well, we've gone through three batches of ambrosia salad.
- Three batches!

236
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:50,472
Not since D-day has there been
such a complete and glorious victory.

237
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,942
Oh, hi, Donna.

238
00:16:53,011 --> 00:16:54,945
Well, I hope you're all happy.

239
00:16:55,013 --> 00:16:57,948
'Cause you ruined
my dad's barbecue.

240
00:16:58,016 --> 00:17:00,780
All he wanted was one more
good day before everybody found out...

241
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:03,582
that his store was closing,
and he's going bankrupt.

242
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,522
- Wait. What?
- Yeah. Bargain Bob's is closing this week...

243
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:09,389
so congratulations.

244
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,362
Oh, my God. I feel so bad.

245
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,833
Well, you should.
You ruined his barbecue.

246
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,670
Why would you do that?

247
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:24,197
What? Me?
You were...

248
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:27,768
Eric, for God's sakes,
the man is almost a veteran.

249
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:33,680
Okay, fine. You know what?
Fine. It's all my fault.

250
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:37,313
But, Dad, you, you gotta make
everyone here go next door.

251
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,687
Eric, you're right.
We have got to go over there.

252
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:42,283
They are our neighbors.
They are our best friends.

253
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,727
Yeah, I suppose.

254
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:50,393
All right, freeloaders.
Let's move it on over to Bob's.

255
00:17:50,468 --> 00:17:54,404
- Eric, grab that keg.
- Okay, I'm on it.

256
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,755
Hey, what's everybody doing here?

257
00:18:11,823 --> 00:18:14,417
Congratulations, Bob,
you really out-barbecued me.

258
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:16,858
I gotta say.
You're one hell of a guy.

259
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:23,193
Oh, Bob.
We just love you so much.

260
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,364
Midge, you told.

261
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:34,008
Look, Bob.
I just want you to know that...

262
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,480
you've been a real good neighbor
and a real good friend.

263
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,847
And if you ever need it,
I'm here for you.

264
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,614
Thanks, Red.

265
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:44,621
Oh, but, uh...

266
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:47,180
I can't help you
if you cry, Bob.

267
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:52,229
- Don't cry.
- These are tears of joy, Red.

268
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,663
Yeah, that's bad too, Bob.

269
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,302
Move!

270
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,306
Come on.

271
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:07,140
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. What's up? Hi.

272
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,117
Look, I'm sorry.

273
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:15,550
Everyone came by,
and I know you did that...

274
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,952
so... thanks.

275
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,355
No, Donna.
I'm sorry.

276
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,985
Look, you know that I wouldn't
have acted like such a jerk...

277
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:26,497
if I knew something so terrible
was happening to your dad.

278
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:29,897
No, I know. I know. It's okay.

279
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,766
- My folks didn't want me to say anything, so.
- Yeah.

280
00:19:32,837 --> 00:19:35,601
No, I mean. Yeah.

281
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,608
Yeah.

282
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:41,778
Are you okay?

283
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:44,872
Yeah, and no.

284
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:48,318
I don't know.

285
00:20:00,865 --> 00:20:03,527
So...

286
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:05,762
our first date's almost over.

287
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,237
Yeah.

288
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:11,036
What'd you think?

289
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,776
It was no worse than bowling.

290
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:19,715
I... I don't hate bowling.

291
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:40,464
Huh.

292
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,775
Okay.
I didn't feel anything.

293
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:50,505
- Nothing?
- No, I mean, the kiss was hot, but...

294
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:55,379
Well, did you feel something?

295
00:20:55,453 --> 00:20:59,412
Uh, no.

296
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:03,985
Well, no.

297
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:13,202
So I guess that's it then.

298
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:15,865
Turns out you were right
about us all along.

299
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,874
Yeah.

300
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,870
So what happens now?

301
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,313
I'm not opposed to doing it.

302
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:30,320
Take me home, you pig.

303
00:21:31,656 --> 00:21:33,886
Yes, dear.

304
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,999
Fez.

305
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:46,364
I don't feel so good.

306
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:48,372
Me neither.

307
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,635
You see a horse?

308
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,370
- Yes, I do.
- Is it pink?

309
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:57,745
Uh-huh.

310
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:05,588
This was the best
barbecue ever.
